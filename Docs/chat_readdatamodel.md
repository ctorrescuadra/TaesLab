The guide provides everything needed to effectively use the ThermoeconomicModel system, from basic single analysis to complex parametric studies. It follows TaesLab's documentation standards and includes practical examples that users can immediately apply to their own thermoeconomic analysis workflows.

The minor markdown linting warnings about code block spacing don't affect the functionality or readability of the documentation, and the guide is ready for use by TaesLab users and developers.
